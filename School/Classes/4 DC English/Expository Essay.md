### The Importance of Physics in Electrical Engineering
	We are in a time when technology has become a part of our everyday lives. Due to this, electrical engineering has emerged as one of the biggest drivers in shaping our digital age. By transforming the principles of electricity and magnetism into tangible technologies, electrical engineers develop new technologies that push society forwards. Although an electrical engineer needs to be proficient in a variety of skills from many classes, advanced physics is the most important. Physics is important because it is needed to understand fundamental principles, develop analytical problem-solving abilities, and navigate cutting-edge technological innovations.
	
	Electromagnetic theory is an integral part of both physics and electrical engineering because it gives insight into the behavior and interactions of electric and magnetic phenomena. These phenomena are the two pillars of electrical engineering and are necessary for understanding the intricate behaviors of circuits and signal. As students learn and progress into physics, they will eventually encounter the mystifying field of quantum mechanics. With the way that current technology is advancing, where devices and components are shrinking to nanoscopic levels, quantum principles are becoming increasingly relevant. Already, these concepts are being put into use in technologies such as semiconductors, transistors, and diodes. An electrical engineer's proficiency and understanding of the workings of quantum mechanics and physics as a whole are indispensable for their career. Additionally, physics, especially branches such as quantum mechanics, is a subject that takes years to master. Starting early in the learning process is one of the biggest advantages an aspiring electrical engineer can get. Although they may not understand the topic fully at the time, as the years progress, their understanding can only deepen, allowing them to have a better understanding of what they are working with as they enter the field.
	
	Physics is not just a reservoir of concepts but also a training ground for the mind. Engineers frequently confront complex challenges, and the problem-solving methodologies learned and honed in physics classes are invaluable. In these classes, students are faced with complex and multi-step problems, learn how to dissect them systematically, and employ various mathematical methods to find solutions. This process cultivates a very specific mindset/way of thinking that is reflected in all engineers. This kind of analytical way of thinking will benefit the students in every aspect of their lives, not just in their work and engineering. It provides a structured approach to tackle the various challenges that await in the real world of circuitry, signal processing, and system design.
	
	Electrical engineering's growth is evident in its continuous evolution, fueled by groundbreaking discoveries and progress in physics. As past research reveals, many pivotal breakthroughs in engineering were preceded and linked to new findings and advancements in physics. For a modern-day electrical engineer, this relationship implies the need to leverage today's knowledge and prepare for tomorrow's innovations. A deep understanding of various fields of physics equips engineers to not only adapt to changes in the field but also drive the next wave of technological breakthroughs, from simple discoveries in materials to transformative breakthroughs in methodologies.
	
	Ultimately, for those aspiring to pursue the field of electrical engineering,  physics is not just a recommended subject â€” it's indispensable. It forms the foundation of understanding, cultivates and hones an analytical mindset, and offers glimpses into the future of technology. As the boundaries of what's possible continue to expand, it will be those prepared and well-versed in physics who will lead the charge. As the future draws near, a strong foundation in physics ensures that electrical engineers are prepared to break limits.
