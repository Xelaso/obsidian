### The Importance of Physics in Electrical Engineering
	Electrical engineering has become a vital field in the world. Due to the increasing dependence and integration of technology into our daily lives, the demand for better technologies has never been higher. Although an electrical engineer needs to be proficient in a variety of skills from many classes, advanced physics is the most important. The concepts and skills learned from physics will become indespensible down the line in work. Physics gives the skills nessecary to understand the principles behind what electrical engineers do, structures an analytical way of thinking, and prepares you to adapt to new technologies
	
	Concepts such as electromagnatism and quantum physics are a mystery to most people. However, for electrical engineers, these are examples of ideas that they must know. These are necessary for understanding the intricate behaviors of circuits and signals — two foundational pillars of electrical engineering. With the way that current technology is advancing, where devices and components are shrinking to nanoscopic levels, quantum principles are becoming increasingly relevant. These concepts get increasingly difficult the deeper you go, with some taking years to fully master. Therefore, students should start learning physics early as to have a fuller understanding once they enter the workforce.
	
	Physics is not just a reservoir of concepts but also a training ground for the mind. Engineers frequently confront complex challenges, and the problem-solving methodologies learned and honed in physics classes are invaluable. In these classes, students are faced with complex and multi-step problems, learn how to dissect them systematically, and employ various mathematical methods to find solutions. This process cultivates a very specific mindset/way of thinking that is reflected in all engineers. This kind of analytical way of thinking will benefit the students in every aspect of their lives, not just in their work and engineering. It provides a structured approach to tackle the various challenges that await in the real world of circuitry, signal processing, and system design.
	
	Electrical engineering's growth is evident in its continuous evolution, fueled by groundbreaking discoveries and progress in physics. As past research reveals, many pivotal breakthroughs in engineering were preceded and linked to new findings and advancements in physics. For a modern-day electrical engineer, this relationship implies the need to leverage today's knowledge and prepare for tomorrow's innovations. A deep understanding of various fields of physics equips engineers to not only adapt to changes in the field but also drive the next wave of technological breakthroughs, from simple discoveries in materials to transformative breakthroughs in methodologies.
	
	Ultimately, for those aspiring to pursue the field of electrical engineering,  physics is not just a recommended subject — it's indispensable. It forms the foundation of understanding, cultivates and hones an analytical mindset, and offers glimpses into the future of technology. As the boundaries of what's possible continue to expand, it will be those prepared and well-versed in physics who will lead the charge. As the future draws near, a strong foundation in physics ensures that electrical engineers are prepared to break limits.
