	During the summer before my senior year, I attended a Harvard Medical School program called Moonshot. The program was focused on combining the medical field with the engineering and computer science fields to foster new ideas and innovative healthcare solutions. Each team in the program was given the task of inventing a solution to better treat non-small cell lung cancer through the use of a bronchoscope. Through this program, I was able to gain insight into the workings of the medical field through tours of hospitals and cancer research labs. I was also able to take a look at the frontier of our generation's medical technologies, such as the DaVinchi surgical robot and a new bronchoscope prototype being developed with the help of Canon. This grew my interest in the technological side of things regarding the medical field. As I learn more about electrical engineering and the various applications it has, I aim to help push the current medical technologies to the next level, leading to affordable robots, increased ease of use, and better results for the patients.
