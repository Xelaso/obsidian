**About**

Shwetadwip Chowdhury is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.

He received his Ph.D. degree from the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Duke University. Afterwards, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at University of California Berkeley, in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences.

His research interests are in developing next generation smart imaging technologies for applications in science and medicine. A key emphasis in this work is the joint co-development of advanced computational algorithms alongside novel optical design to enable imaging capabilities not possible in traditional imaging systems. Furthermore, this work also emphasizes the tight integration of these technological developments into robust and versatile imaging pipelines for broad scientific imaging applications.
