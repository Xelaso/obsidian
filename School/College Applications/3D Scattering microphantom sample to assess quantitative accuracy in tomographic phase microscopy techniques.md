## Abstract

In this paper we present a structurally-complex biomimetic scattering structure, fabricated with two-photon polymerization, and utilize this object in order to benchmark a computational imaging system. The phantom allows to tailor the scattering by modifying its degrees of freedom i.e. refractive index contrast and scattering layer dimensions and incorporates a 3D imaging quality test, representing a single cell within tissue. While the sample may be used with multiple 3D microscopy techniques, we demonstrate the impact of scattering on three tomographic phase microscopy (TPM) reconstruction methods. One of these methods assumes the sample to be weak-scattering, while the other two take multiple scattering into account. The study is performed at two wavelengths (visible and near-infrared), which serve as a scaling factor for the scattering phenomenon. We find that changing the wavelength from visible into near-infrared impacts the applicability of TPM reconstruction methods. As a result of reduced scattering in near-infrared region, the multiple-scattering-oriented techniques perform in fact worse than a method aimed for weak-scattering samples. This implies a necessity of selecting proper approach depending on sample’s scattering characteristics even in case of subtle changes in the object-light interaction.

## Introduction

One of the modern challenges in computational optics is to image scattering samples with high resolution[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24193-7#ref-CR1 "Yoon, S. et al. Deep optical imaging within complex scattering media. Nature Rev. Phys. 2, 141–158 (2020)."). This can be attributed to the fact that complex biological structures such as spheroids or organoids tend to be more relevant models than 2D cell cultures e.g. for drug discovery[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24193-7#ref-CR2 "Chatzinikolaidou, M. Cell spheroids: The new frontiers in in vitro models for cancer drug validation. Drug Discov. Today 21, 1553–1560 (2016)."). Also, most in vivo imaging techniques require the probing light to pass through the complex structure of a tissue which highly limits imaging depths due to multiple scattering. This demand stimulates the development of new methods[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24193-7#ref-CR1 "Yoon, S. et al. Deep optical imaging within complex scattering media. Nature Rev. Phys. 2, 141–158 (2020)."),[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24193-7#ref-CR3 "Pierré, W. et al. 3D time-lapse imaging of a mouse embryo using intensity diffraction tomography embedded inside a deep learning framework. Appl. Opt. 61, 3337 (2022)."),[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24193-7#ref-CR4 "Rios, A. C. & Clevers, H. Imaging organoids: A bright future ahead.

Nature Protocols 14, 1756–1771 (2019)."), however, it is difficult to select an appropriate one based on the scattering strength of the analyzed specimen. For this reason a versatile, repeatable and quantitative method for the evaluation of different imaging systems and algorithms is essential to determine their limits of applicability depending on the object’s scattering properties. One possibility is to use calibrated microphantoms as imaging targets. Unfortunately, existing microphantoms are typically either weak-scattering (e.g. index-matched microspheres) or overly simplistic (e.g. index-mismatched microspheres)[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24193-7#ref-CR6 "Lim, J. et al. Comparative study of iterative reconstruction algorithms for missing cone problems in optical diffraction tomography. Opt. Express 23, 16933–16948 (2015)."),[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24193-7#ref-CR7 "Sung, Y. & Dasari, R. R. Deterministic regularization of three-dimensional optical diffraction tomography. JOSA A 28, 1554–1561 (2011).") compared to the types of heterogenously scattering multicellular samples that multiple-scattering methods are intended for. This is a critical limitation when characterizing computational imaging methods that utilize nonconvex solvers, where iterative convergence depends on the complexity of the energy landscape and directly associates with a sample’s 3D complexity[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24193-7#ref-CR8 "Hindi, H. A tutorial on convex optimization. In Proceedings of the 2004 American Control Conference, vol. 4 3252–3265 (IEEE, 2004).").

In this work we present a 3D-printed microphantom with multiple-scattering refractive index (RI) distribution. To do so, we leverage recent developments in 3D printing via direct laser writing[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24193-7#ref-CR9 "Lamont, A. C. et al.

When compared to other implementations of direct laser writing, it allows (1) to control the RI with relatively high modulation range, (2) to adjust the RI contrast or scattering strength post-fabrication using different immersion liquid and (3) to handle and measure the microphantom in the same way as biological specimens. Next, we present the application of the phantom in the field of tomographic phase microscopy (TPM), a technique which has demonstrated impressive biological imaging results in prior works. However, it is important to note that all computational imaging methods can be evaluated with the proposed procedure.

TPM is a quantitative, label-free imaging method that utilizes optical projections through a semi-transparent sample along various illumination angles to reconstruct the sample’s 3D RI. This method has found several applications in biological imaging, where RI is directly related to the dry mass distribution at the cellular and subcellular levels. Refractive index and dry mass are known to be crucial factors in analyzing the current stage of cell cycle[19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24193-7#ref-CR19 "Girshovitz, P. & Shaked, N.

Given the wealth of information provided by the dry mass at the single-cell level, there is significant demand to extend the capability to analyze dry mass to large multicellular clusters, thick tissue slices, or whole microorganisms. However, to reconstruct 3D RI, traditional TPM methods utilize critical assumptions in their computational reconstruction methodologies that rely on the sample being _weakly scattering_[25](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24193-7#ref-CR25 "Chen, B. & Stamnes, J. J. Validity of diffraction tomography based on the first Born and the first Rytov approximations. Appl. Opt. 37, 2996–3006 (1998)."). These assumptions limit samples to having thicknesses on the order of only tens of microns. For thick, complex samples, reconstruction frameworks that accommodate for _multiple scattering_ must be utilized. To this end, numerous TPM approaches have been proposed in recent years that introduce new frameworks to accommodate multiple scattering[26](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24193-7#ref-CR26 "Lee, M., Hugonnet, H. & Park, Y.

High-resolution 3D refractive index microscopy of multiple-scattering samples from intensity images. Optica 6, 1211 (2019)."). Notably, these approaches utilize nonlinear and nonconvex solvers to iteratively solve for a sample’s 3D RI. Though these methods have demonstrated impressive results in reconstructing RI in multiple-scattering samples, their quantitative accuracy has not yet been robustly characterized experimentally, and the presented results usually do not allow comparison of different methods in order to select proper approach for a given scattering level in a sample. The general strategy to experimentally evaluate quantitative accuracy in TPM methods is to reconstruct 3D RI in samples with known RI distributions[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24193-7#ref-CR6 "Lim, J. et al. Comparative study of iterative reconstruction algorithms for missing cone problems in optical diffraction tomography. Opt. Express 23, 16933–16948 (2015)."),[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24193-7#ref-CR7 "Sung, Y. & Dasari, R. R.

Beyond Born-Rytov limit for super-resolution optical diffraction tomography. Opt. Express 25, 30445–30458 (2017)."). A multiple-scattering TPM method that outputs accurate 3D RI reconstructions of a weakly scattering or overly simplistic microphantom cannot be expected to output similarly accurate RI reconstructions for more complex multiple-scattering samples, where the probability of converging to local minima is drastically higher. To robustly characterize the quantitative accuracy of multiple-scattering TPM methods, it is imperative to use microphantoms with known 3D RI that mimic the structural complexity of the types of samples that the TPM methods are intended to image. _To the best of our knowledge, these types of gold-standard multiple-scattering microphantoms do not exist._

## Results

In this section we present the design of the 3D printed microphantom and its application in evaluation of three TPM reconstruction methods.
