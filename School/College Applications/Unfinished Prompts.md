Purdue:

How will opportunities at Purdue support your interests, both in and out of the classroom? (Respond in 250 words or fewer.)

UIUC:

Explain, in detail, an experience you've had in the past 3 to 4 years related to your first-choice major. This can be an experience from an extracurricular activity, in a class you’ve taken, or through something else.


 During the summer before my senior year, I attended a Harvard Medical School program called Moonshot. The program was focused on combining the medical field with the engineering and computer science fields to foster new ideas and innovative healthcare solutions. On our first day, we were split into teams and tasked to compete in the "pasta tower" challenge. Each team was given a set amount of pasta sticks and a package of marshmallows and needed to create the tallest stable tower possible. This activity was to not only test our engineering and problem solving abilities, but also our teamwork and capability to work with new people. We were then introduced to the overarching problem that we were to solve during our time at this program and once again split into teams. Each team was given the task of inventing a solution to better treat non-small cell lung cancer through the use of a bronchoscope. To streamline the process, we split our team so each member had a specified role. I was designated as the engineer and tasked to design and construct the prototype. Throughout the program, I was able to gain insight into the workings of the medical field through tours of hospitals and cancer research labs. I was also able to take a look at the frontier of our generation's medical technologies, such as the DaVinci surgical robot and a new bronchoscope prototype being developed with the help of Canon. This grew my interest in the technological side of things regarding the medical field. 

  

Describe your personal and/or career goals after graduating from UIUC and how your selected first-choice major will help you achieve them.

  After graduating from UIUC, my personal and career goal is to apply my electrical engineering knowledge and help push the current medical technologies to the next level, leading to affordable robots, increased ease of use, and better results for the patients. 

You have selected a second-choice major. Please explain your interest in that major or your overall academic or career goals.

Cornell:

In the aftermath of the U.S. Civil War, Ezra Cornell wrote, "I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study." For over 150 years, Cornell University has remained deeply committed to Ezra’s vision. Explain how your life experiences will help inform your contributions to a learning community devoted to “...any person…any study.” We encourage you to think broadly about your life experiences, including how local (e.g., family, school, neighborhood) or global communities you’ve been part of have helped shape your perspective.

  

How do your interests directly connect with Cornell Engineering? If you have an intended major, what draws you to that department at Cornell Engineering?  If you are unsure what specific engineering field you would like to study, describe how your general interest in engineering most directly connects with Cornell Engineering. It may be helpful to concentrate on one or two things that you are most excited about.
