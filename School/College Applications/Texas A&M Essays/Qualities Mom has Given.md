Qualities: persevering through failure and hardships and the self control and responsibility to motivate myself and push myself forward in school and extra curriculars. -Example/Memories of each quality: Perseverance: Sports; had me go into sports from a young age (basketball and swimming) which allowed me to experience the difficulty of training and failure from losing games or not making the mark. This helped mold me and prepare me for future setbacks in school and other sports ventures. Self-control: My mother was very strict, making sure I had good grades and studied hard. This would lead into my rebellious phase, which I overcame and realized that I would need have self control in order to do well later in life. This would translate into my improving grades, increased motivation to study and do well, and overall move from someone motivating me and pushing me to me pushing myself and wanting to improve myself.
