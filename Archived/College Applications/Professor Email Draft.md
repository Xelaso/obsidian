Dear [Professor Name],  
  
I hope this email finds you well. My name is Alexander So, and I am an aspiring electrical engineer with an interest in fields that can help facilitate progress in the medical field. [what I know about them.] I recently attended a program in Harvard Medical School which allowed me to see many of the inner workings in hospitals and research and development facilities. Through the program, I became interested in the application of ECE to the medical field to help advance the technologies currently available. 
  
Your work aligns closely with my academic and research interests in regard to the medical field, and as an applying 2024 freshman,  I am eager to understand more about the opportunities UT offers for research in this domain. Could you give a few quick words on how students typically get involved in research projects at UT? Are there specific programs or initiatives that you would recommend for someone with my interests? I would greatly appreciate any advice you might have for someone at the beginning of their research journey in electrical engineering.  
  
Thank you for taking the time to read my email. I genuinely hope to contribute to and learn from the research being conducted at UT. I look forward to hearing from you.  
  
Thank you,  
  
Alexander So
